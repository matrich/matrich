- 👋 Hi, I’m Richard Matovu, aka @matrich, currently an Assistant Professor of Cybersecurity at Gannon University. 
I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Texas Tech University, US (in 2020), master’s degree in Data Communication & Software Engineering and bachelor’s degree in Statistics, both from Makerere University, Uganda (in 2010 and 2006, respectively).
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, Biometrics, and Healthcare AI. My most recent works are in improvement of user experience and augmentation of end-user security in mobile, wearable, and IoT devices. 
- 🌱 I’m currently designing and evaluating novel behavioral biometrics on mobile devices as well as studying side-channel attacks on those devices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the areas above.
- 📫 Reach me at matovu001[AT]gannon.edu.
