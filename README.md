- 👋 Hi, I’m Richard Matovu, aka @matrich, currently an Assistant Professor of Cybersecurity at Gannon University. 
- I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Texas Tech University, US (in 2020), master’s degree in Data Communication & Software Engineering and bachelor’s degree in Statistics, both from Makerere University, Uganda (in 2010 and 2006, respectively). Additionally, I have multiple nanodegrees from Udacity including Ethical Hacking, Security Engineer, Deep Learning, and Data Engineering. 
- 🌱 I also have extensive industry experience in software engineering, business intelligence, websites, and web applications. 
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, Biometrics, and Healthcare AI. My most recent works are in improvement of user experience and augmentation of end-user security in mobile, wearable, and IoT devices. 
- 👀 I’m currently designing and evaluating novel behavioral biometrics on mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, smartwatches, EEG and VR headsets, etc.) as well as investigating side-channel attacks on those devices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the areas above.
